cards:
- term: Congruent Segments
  full_def: If two segments are congruent, then they have the same length.
  quiz_question: What do you call two segments that have the same length?
- term: Congruent Angles
  full_def: If two angles are congruent, then they have the same degree measure.
  quiz_question: What do you call two angles that have the same degree measure?
- term: Angle Bisector
  full_def: If a ray bisects an angle, then it divides the angle into two congruent
    angles.
  quiz_question: What is a ray that divides an angle into two congruent angles called?
- term: Complementary Angles
  full_def: If two angles are complementary angles, then the sum of their measures
    is 90°.
  quiz_question: What do you call two angles if the sum of their measures is 90°?
- term: Supplementary Angles
  full_def: If two angles are supplementary angles, then the sum of their measures
    is 180°.
  quiz_question: What do you call two angles if the sum of their measures is 180°?
- term: Perpendicular Lines
  full_def: If two lines, segments, or rays are perpendicular, then they intersect
    to create 4 right angles.
  quiz_question: What do you call lines that intersect to create 4 right angles?
- term: Right Angles
  full_def: If an angle is a right angle, then it has a measure of 90°.
  quiz_question: What is an angle that has a measure of 90° called?
- term: Midpoint
  full_def: If a point is a midpoint, then it is between the endpoints and equidistant
    from the endpoints of a segment.
  quiz_question: What is the point on a segment that is equidistant from both endpoints?
- term: Segment Bisector
  full_def: If a point, line, or ray bisects a segment, then it divides the segment
    into two congruent segments.
  quiz_question: What do you call a point, line, or ray that divides a segment into
    two congruent segments?
- term: Betweenness of Points
  full_def: Point M is between points P and Q if and only if P, Q, M are collinear
    and PM + MQ = PQ.
  quiz_question: What property states that point M is between P and Q if P, Q, M are
    collinear and PM + MQ = PQ?
